sideLength = 50 #Number of tiles in the side â€” 300 is probably the maximum for a nice maze, feel free to experiment with sizes. 990 renders correctly, anything beyond that doesnt fit the pixels of the screen - the algorithms still work but some tiles are not displayed.
offset = 0  # For 0, the maze has no edges; for 1, normal edges; for i > 1, 'tile effect'.

#Settings for window size; the sidebar has hardcoded positions of UI elements => they may not render correctly when these settings change. If you have less than 1920x1080 resolution I recommend 
# setting widthGrid and heightGrid to 700
width_menu = 300
widthGrid = heightGrid = 990
